h2. Introduction

This "GTFS(General Transit Feed Specification) Engine" is a "Rails Engine":rails-engine which will allow your Rails application to process GTFS feeds and model their associations through __ActiveRecord__ objects.

This project is currently a sub-component of the "KnowTime Server":knowtime-git project, but hopefully can of use to others projects. This project also depends on another GitHub project, "GTFS Reader":gtfs-reader-git, to actually process the __.zip__ files in which GTFS feeds are contained.

h2. Example

A live example is running as part of the KnowTime Server project at "api.knowtime.ca/v2/gtfs":http://api.knowtime.ca/v2/gtfs

h2. Configuration

You can add @gtf-engine@ to your Rails application the same way as you would any Rails Engine. Simply:

Add the following to your @Gemfile@:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'gtfs-engine'
{% endhighlight %}

And then you only have to mount the engine at some path. Add something like the following to your @config/routes.rb@ file:

{% highlight ruby %}
mount GtfsEngine::Engine, at: '/gtfs'
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, you need to import the DB migration files that define the GTFS resources used by this engine:

{% highlight bash %}
rake 'gtfs_engine:install:migrations'
{% endhighlight %}


h3. Sources

To actually get GTFS data into your database, you need to specify the sources of your data. The easiest way to do this is to create an "initializer file":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#using-initializer-files that species all of the GTFS data sources you are interested in. Here is an example:

{% highlight ruby %}
GtfsEngine.sources do |source|
  source.halifax do
    title 'Halifax Metro'
    url 'http://www.example.com/metrotransit.zip'
  end
  source.edmonton do
    title 'Edmonton Transit System'
    url 'http://example.com/etsdatafeed.zip'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

That being said, the source data is only used when updating the data sources. As this is most often done via @rake@ takes (see below), you may want to restrict your configuration to that.


h2. Resources

* "DataSet":{{ site.url }}/resources/data_set

* "Agency":{{ site.url }}/resources/agency
* "Stop":{{ site.url }}/resources/stop
* "Route":{{ site.url }}/resources/route
* "Trip":{{ site.url }}/resources/trip
* "StopTime":{{ site.url }}/resources/stop_time
* "Calendar":{{ site.url }}/resources/calendar
* "CalendarDate":{{ site.url }}/resources/calendar_date
* "FareAttribute":{{ site.url }}/resources/fare_attribute
* "FareRule":{{ site.url }}/resources/fare_rule
* "Shape":{{ site.url }}/resources/shape
* "Frequency":{{ site.url }}/resources/frequency
* "Transfer":{{ site.url }}/resources/transfer
* "FeedInfo":{{ site.url }}/resources/feed_info


h2. JSend

The GTFS Engine currently returns only one type of content: "JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)":wiki-json; moreover, the returned data is wrapped in a "JSend-compliant response":jsend


h2. Rake Tasks

This Rails Engine provides a few @rake@ tasks to help you maintain your GTFS data sets.

h3. Install Migration

{% highlight bash %}
rake 'gtfs_engine:install:migrations'
{% endhighlight %}

Like most Rails Engines, this engine defines many @ActiveRecord@ classes, representing the various GTFS resources. This rake task will copy these migration files to your Rails app's @db/migrate@ directory.

h3. List the DataSets in the database

{% highlight bash %}
rake 'gtfs_engine:sets:list'
{% endhighlight %}

This lists all of the DataSets in the database. The sets are ordered under a heading for each source.

h4. Example Output

<pre>
halifax
    ac43f674eaa0cf1:0: 2014-07-19 00:25:55 -0300 (http://www.halifax.ca/metrotransit/googletransitfeed/google_transit.zip)
    d57-4f669d05eedfd: 2014-07-19 00:52:32 -0300 (http://localhost/sample-feed.zip)

edmonton
    52699964659bcf1:0: 2014-07-19 00:31:46 -0300 (http://webdocs.edmonton.ca/transit/etsdatafeed/google_transit.zip)
</pre>

h3. Update a DataSource

{% highlight bash %}
rake 'gtfs_engine:update[name]'
{% endhighlight %}

Checks the URL for the named Data Source and, if it's new, download it and insert its resources into the DB.

h3. Update every DataSource

{% highlight bash %}
rake 'gtfs_engine:update'
{% endhighlight %}

Updates every DataSource configured with @GtfsEngine.sources@.

h3. Delete a DataSource

{% highlight bash %}
rake 'gtfs_engine:sets:delete[name,etag]'
{% endhighlight %}

Deletes the DataSet from the [*name*]d source with the given *etag*.

h3. Count the Resources in a DataSet

{% highlight bash %}
rake 'gtfs_engine:sets:count[name,etag]'
{% endhighlight %}

h4. Example Output

<pre>
Model count for halifax data set with etag ac43f674eaa0cf1:0
               agencies: 1
              calendars: 14

              transfers: 0
